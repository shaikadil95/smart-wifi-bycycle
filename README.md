Prototype development
1.Initial version v0.1
Our first mini exercise bike, V0.1, including a handheld cable that remote controlled the motor and resistance as well as presenting kcal count, etc. 


wrote the code in Python and executed on the Pi connected to the bike hall sensor (pic). A standard Raspberry Pi 3B+ (a mini-computer), a standard WiFi antenna for the Pi, a 3‚Äù screen and a hall sensor (pic) complete the picture.

A demonstration was held in October 2019 in Stockholm where successfully managed to demonstrate the core features of the invention:

Ability to connect to an existing WiFi and spawn a new SID for the bike users, with a separate password
Read the exercise progress with the hall sensor 
Reward system with credits which enables/disables bike (Pi) WiFi access.
Ability to control the resistance with software and Raspberry Pi computer instead of the handheld remote.

The architecture of the code that was tested running on a Raspberry Pi B+:
