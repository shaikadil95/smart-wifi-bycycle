wrote the code in Python and executed on the Pi connected to the bike hall sensor (pic). A standard Raspberry Pi 3B+ (a mini-computer), a standard WiFi antenna for the Pi, a 3‚Äù screen and a hall sensor (pic) complete the picture.

A demonstration was held in October 2019 in Stockholm where successfully managed to demonstrate the core features of the invention:

Ability to connect to an existing WiFi and spawn a new SID for the bike users, with a separate password
Read the exercise progress with the hall sensor 
Reward system with credits which enables/disables bike (Pi) WiFi access.
Ability to control the resistance with software and Raspberry Pi computer instead of the handheld remote.
